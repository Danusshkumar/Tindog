# Tindog

Tindog is a website that helps you find the perfect match for your dog. It is a fun and engaging project that I created as part of **The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp** by **Angela Yu**. This project helped me learn and practice web development skills such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Features

- Responsive design using **Bootstrap** framework. The website adapts to different screen sizes and devices using Bootstrap's grid system, containers, rows, and columns.
- Attractive layout using **HTML** and **CSS**. The website uses semantic HTML elements and CSS properties to create a visually appealing layout with colors, fonts, icons, images, and animations.
- Creative content and images. The website uses catchy headlines, slogans, testimonials, and images to showcase the benefits of tindog and how it works.
